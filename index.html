    <p class="researchP">
      This website is meant to explain the basics of what a reference frame is in 2-D space, how to define the location of objects in that reference frame using vectors, and handling changes in coordinate frames. On this site you can also find
      representations of the following rotations in 3-D space:
    <ul class="introduction" id="introduction">

      <li><a href="pages/movingFrom2DIntro.html">Cartesian coordinate system right-handed & left-handed rotations</a></li>

    Dr. Clark Taylor has provided research on these topics, and you'll find interactive examples within each paper to help you along the way.
