        <h1>3&nbsp;Changing Coordinate Frames</h1>
        A reference frame for Cartesian coordinate systems is defined by two things: an origin and a set of orthonormal vectors that define directions away from the origin. Let's start with a change of origin location. We will be attempting to
        transform from my (<i>m</i>) coordinate frame to yours (<i>y</i>).
        <br>
        <br>

              <h2>3.1&nbsp;Handling a change in coordinate origin</h2></small>
          <i>If you and I are both facing the same direction</i>, all you need to know is where <b>I</b> am in your coordinate frame. We denote this quantity <b>m</b> where the coordinate frame's letter is bolded to show it is a vector. The
          transformation is now a simple vector addition operation
          <br>
          <center><b>x<sup>y</sup></b>=<b>x<sup>m</sup> + m</b></center>

          This addition is illustrated in Figure 2. While this equation is conceptually very simple, please realize it is for pedagogical purposes only! In fact, <i>please forget it</i> because the caveat to use it, that the axes are the same for the
          coordinate frames m and y, makes it almost useless. (That is why that equation is <i>not</i> numbered! Please don't refer to it!)
